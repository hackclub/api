    Hi :wave:! I'm Hack Club's friendly :robot_face: helper. I don't do much right now, but if you're a leader you've probably received some messages from me about the attendance of your club.

    Here are the commands I know:

    <% commands.each do |c| %>
    `<%= c[:usage] %>` - <%= c[:desc] %>
    <% end %>

    To use one of them, go ahead and say `<%= bot_mention %>` and then the command you want to run, like `<%= bot_mention %> <%= commands.sample[:usage] %>`.
