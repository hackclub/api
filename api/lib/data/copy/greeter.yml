  Hey! I’m Orpheus, Hack Club’s friendly robot dino. I'd like to extend a warm welcome from the entirety of our community to you:heart:

  The first thing you should do is join <#C75M7C0SY> and introduce yourself.

  Once you’ve done that, you should start joining the channels that best represent your interests:

  - <#C0J7C6YET>: thinking about starting a club? Currently leading a club and running into an issue with it? This is the perfect place to ask the rest of Hack Club for some advice!

  - <#C0EA9S0A0>: can’t figure out where that pesky `undefined is not a function` error message is coming from? Want to argue about the virtues of Emacs? Get all of your programming related questions answered here, no matter what it’s related to

  - <#C0C78SG9L>: is a place where all of Hack Club’s staff hang out and talk about the day-to-day of what’s happening in the org

  - <#C0266FRGV>: where to go if you’re ready to kick back after a rough day at school. Knock out a few memes, get up to date on the latest internet trends – it’s like a bar, but on the internet, filled with minors, and doesn’t serve alcohol. There may or may not be billiards

  - <#C0D845A5S>: looking for a college to drop out of and start the next Facebook from? Look no further. Get some (probably) much needed feedback on your college application, while also silently judging others

  - <#C6C026NHJ>: an army of veteran computer builders awaits you. They sit behind their 4k monitors, oil cooled PCs, typing away on their mechanical keyboards, while sipping from a bottle of 3 day old mountain dew. They’re up for discussions about anything to do with the hardware of computers (yes, laptops are included)

  That’s about it from me! If you have any questions about Hack Club or want to talk to the staff, hop into <#C0C78SG9L> and give <!subteam^S0DJXPY14> a mention.
