        Hey <%= first_name %>! I'm Orpheus, Hack Club's friendly robot dinosaur.

        I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way 🙂

        text: Hey! We've been getting feedback that a lot of schools are heading into summer and/or exams right now, and are no longer planning on meeting this school year. Basically, if you're one of these leaders, we'd like to give you a way to opt-out of check-ins. So, are you on a school break right now and not planning on meeting until the next school year?
