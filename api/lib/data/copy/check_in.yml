greeting:

        Hey <%= first_name %>! I'm Orpheus, Hack Club's friendly robot dinosaur.

        I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way :slightly_smiling_face:

        To start, did you have a club meeting this week?
    if_first_check_in_of_semester: |
      Hey <%= first_name %>! Orpheus here (I've just changed my name from Hackbot :P), hope you've had a great break!
      
      You've been scheduled to restart your club this week, if this is no longer true (or there's some other issue) you should message <@U0C7BTKLG> to get it resolved.
      
      OK, time for the check-in: Did you have a meeting this week?
    default: |
      Hey <%= first_name %>... Notice anything different about me? Yep, that's right -- I changed my name! You can call me Orpheus now :)

      Let's get started — please be sure to complete this check-in by <%= deadline %>. Did your club meet this week?
    restart: Let's start again! Did your club meet this week?

        text: Hey! We've been getting feedback that a lot of schools are heading into summer and/or exams right now, and are no longer planning on meeting this school year. Basically, if you're one of these leaders, we'd like to give you a way to opt-out of check-ins. So, are you on a school break right now and not planning on meeting until the next school year?
        actions:
            - text: "Yes! Stop pinging me"
              value: "yes"
            - text: "We're still meeting."
              value: "no"
    not_dormant: That's great. Back to the normal flow. Did you have a club meeting this week?

is_dormant:
    positive:
        text: That's cool. When will your break end? (Say something like "in two months")
        action_result: ":black_square_for_stop: Stop sending check-ins until break is over."
    negative:
        action_result: ":pencil: Keep sending me check-ins! We're still meeting"

resurrection_date:
    unknown: I'm not that smart and couldn't understand that date. Try saying something like "in three months" or "twelve weeks".
    success: Awesome! I'll be in touch a few weeks before then. Please let the Hack Club staff know if you have any questions.

meeting_confirmation:
    had_meeting:
        action_result: ":white_check_mark: You had a meeting"
        ask_day_of_week: Okay, sweet! On which day was it? (say something like "monday" or "today" – I'm not very clever)
    no_meeting:
        action_result: ":no_entry: You did not have a meeting"
        ask_why: That's a shame! Why didn't you meet?
    previous_meeting_day: ":white_check_mark: You had a meeting on <%= day %>"

no_meeting_reason: Gotcha. Are you planning on having a club meeting in the future?

meeting_in_the_future:
    positive: Gotcha, is there anything preventing you from having your next meeting? If not, please respond with "no".
    negative: That's a shame. I'll let the Hack Club team know.
    invalid: I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you :-/. Try saying something like 'yes' or 'no'

day_of_week:
    unknown: ":disappointed: I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you. Try saying something simpler, like \"tuesday\" or \"thursday\"."
    invalid: Hmm, that date didn't happen in the past week (although I may be misunderstanding you). Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: How many people would you estimate came? (I'm not very smart, I'll need you to give me a single number, something like "25" – give your best estimate)

judgement:
    ok: Nice!
    good: <%= count %> is a number to be proud of!
    great: Damn, <%= count %> is a huge number of people!
    awesome: I have no words. <%= count %> people is incredible!
    amazing: I'm speechless. That's incredible.

attendance:
    invalid: I didn't quite understand that. Can you try giving a single number?
    not_realistic:
        negative: I'm going to need a positive number, silly. How many people came to the last meeting?
        too_large: That number is too big for our database! How many people actually came to your last meeting?
    valid: <%= judgement %> Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with?

notes_confirmation:
    has_notes:
        action_result: ":white_check_mark: You could use help from the Hack Club team"
        ask: What should I send to them?
    no_notes:
        action_result: ":no_entry: You don't need any help right now"

submit_confirmation:

    wants_to_be_dead: Club is ending
    submit:
        action_result: ":airplane_departure: Check in submitted"
    restart:
        action_result: ":leftwards_arrow_with_hook: You want to start over"

submit_check_in: Gotcha, I'll pass that on to the Hack Club team! Hope you have a hack-tastic weekend!
