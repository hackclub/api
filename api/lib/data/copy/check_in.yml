greeting:

        Hey <%= first_name %>! I'm Orpheus, Hack Club's friendly robot dinosaur.

        I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way 🙂

        To start, did you have a club meeting this week?
    if_first_check_in_of_semester: |
      Hey <%= first_name %>! Orpheus here, hope you've had a great break!
      
      You've been scheduled to restart your club this week, if this is no longer true (or there's some other issue) you should message <@U0C7BTKLG> to get it resolved.
      
      OK, time for the check-in: Did you have a meeting this week?
    default: |
      Hey <%= first_name %>, <%= flavor_text %>

      Let's get started — please be sure to complete this check-in by <%= deadline %>. Did your club meet this week?
    restart: Let's start again! Did your club meet this week?

        text: Hey! We've been getting feedback that a lot of schools are heading into summer and/or exams right now, and are no longer planning on meeting this school year. Basically, if you're one of these leaders, we'd like to give you a way to opt-out of check-ins. So, are you on a school break right now and not planning on meeting until the next school year?

    negative:
        action_result: "✏️ Keep sending me check-ins! We're still meeting"

resurrection_date:
    unknown: I'm not that smart and couldn't understand that date. Try saying something like "in three months" or "twelve weeks".
    success: Awesome! I'll be in touch a few weeks before then. Please let the Hack Club staff know if you have any questions.

day_of_week:
    unknown: "😔 I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you. Try saying something simpler, like \"tuesday\" or \"thursday\"."
    invalid: Hmm, that date didn't happen in the past week (although I may be misunderstanding you). Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: How many people would you estimate came? (I'm not very smart, I'll need you to give me a single number, something like "25" – give your best estimate)

attendance:

    not_realistic:
        negative: I'm going to need a positive number, silly. How many people came to the last meeting?
        too_large: That number is too big for our database! How many people actually came to your last meeting?
    valid: <%= judgement %> Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with?
