      <Text>Dear applicant,</Text>
      <Text>
        At this point in Hack Club's history, we've worked with hundreds of high
        schoolers to start over 200 Hack Clubs.

        One of the things we've learned is that it's very difficult to predict a
        club's success from the initial leader's application. We've had clubs we
        nearly rejected succeed beyond expectation and we've had clubs we were
        excited about fail miserably.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The one pattern we have noticed across nearly all clubs is that their
        success or failure is almost always a result of the club's leadership.
        The leaders make the club.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Our best clubs are led by leaders that are gritty. By people who will
        stop at nothing to see their goals through. People who see challenges
        and instead of asking "why" ask "why not".
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Our best leaders are thoughtful. They think deeply about the world
        around them and break things down to their fundamentals. They look for
        simpler ways to do things, not accepting the status quo.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Our best leaders are team players and understand it takes more than one
        person to build an institution at their school.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Our goal with this application is to get a taste of who you are. Are you
        gritty? How do you think about the world? What are the deeply personal
        experiences you've had that have led you to applying today?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        These days, we accept nearly everyone who applies to start a Hack Club
        because we know how terrible we are at predicting success. But we do
        want you to take this seriously.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Your answers to this application will determine how weâ€™ll work with you.
        They'll tell us what kind of person you are, who you'll work with at
        Hack Club, and how we should help you get your club off the ground.
      </Text>
