### Build the container & install dependencies for runtime environment

    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose run web bundle
    $ docker-compose run web rails db:create db:setup

Run tests to ensure everything is working as expected:

    $ docker-compose run web rails spec

### Setting up the integrated Slack bot

1. Create a new Slack app on Slack
2. Create one (and only one) bot user and set "Always Show My Bot as Online" to "On"
3. Click "Event Subscriptions" on the sidebar in the left and set the request URL to `HOSTNAME/v1/hackbot/webhooks/events`, replacing `HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname.
4. Subscribe to the following bot events: `message.channels`, `message.im`, `message.groups`, `message.mpim`
5. Click "Interactive Messages" on the left sidebar and set the request URL to `HOSTNAME/v1/hackbot/webhooks/interactive_messages`, replacing `HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname.
6. Manually go through the Oauth flow and POST `code` to `/v1/hackbot/auth`

## Production Setup

### Scheduled Jobs

This application depends on a few jobs running periodically in the background. Set this up using cron or a similar scheduler on your deployment of the application -- we use Heroku's scheduler in production.

- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_update_hackbot_slack_username_job` hourly
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_record_slack_stats_job` daily
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_activate_clubs_job` daily
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_collect_projects_shipped_job` daily
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_schedule_leader_check_ins_job` daily
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_handle_spam_club_applications_job` every 10 minutes
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_update_from_streak_job` hourly
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_close_check_ins_job` daily

### Deployment on Heroku

We use Heroku for managing our deployment of this project and that brings along some special caveats. Specifically, we rely on multiple buildpacks.

Here are the buildpacks that need to be configured (they must be in the given order):

```
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-activestorage-preview
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
heroku/ruby
```

Refer to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks for instructions on configuring buildpacks.

### Profiling

We use [Skylight](https://www.skylight.io) to profile the performance of our backend in production. To use it, you must set `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION` in the environment to the value that Skylight gives you.
