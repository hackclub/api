## How to get it set up

Go through the [web setup](#web-setup) and [api setup](#api-setup). Once you've got that done you can spin up both at the same time with this command:

And then `api` and `web` should be live!

## Web Setup

Create a file called `web/.env` with the following contents, replacing "REPLACEME" with actual values:

```sh
# For server-rendered meta tags
REACT_APP_META_TITLE="Start your own Hack Club!"
REACT_APP_META_DESCRIPTION="Learn in your own environment, your own way. Join a network of club leaders around the world who can help you every step of the way."
# In production this is set to "https://hackclub.com/meta_og_image.png"
REACT_APP_META_OG_IMAGE="localhost:3001/meta_og_image.png"

# For Segment analytics
REACT_APP_SEGMENT_KEY=REPLACEME

# For requests to the API used in workshops, slack invites, etc.
# In production this is set to "https://api.hackclub.com"
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=localhost:3000

# For Hackbot new team auth
REACT_APP_SLACK_CLIENT_ID=REPLACEME

# For the donations page
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=REPLACEME

# For error tracking
REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=REPLACEME

# For Stripe donations
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=REPLACEME
```

All these values are mandatory.

Right now we only maintain web running on docker. While just spinning up the server with node on your own machine should work, milage may vary.

```sh
docker-compose build web
docker-compose run web yarn
```

```sh
# Now you can start up web anytime you want
docker-compose up web
```

## API Setup

### Environmental Variables

Create a file called `api/.env`. The following configuration options are available to set in it:

```
# Number of Rails threads to run per server instance. One database connection is
# made per thread (ex. if this is set to 5, then the database connection pool
# will hold 5 connections).

### Build the container

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
docker-compose build api
docker-compose run api bundle
docker-compose run api rails db:create db:migrate
```

### Setting up the Slack App

1. Create a new Slack app on Slack
2. Create one (and only one) bot user and set "Always Show My Bot as Online" to "On"
3. Click "Event Subscriptions" on the sidebar in the left and set the request URL to `HOSTNAME/v1/hackbot/webhooks/events`, replacing `HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname.
4. Subscribe to the following bot events: `message.channels`, `message.im`, `message.groups`, `message.mpim`
5. Click "Interactive Messages" on the left sidebar and set the request URL to `HOSTNAME/v1/hackbot/webhooks/interactive_messages`, replacing `HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname.

### Scheduled Jobs

This application depends on a few jobs running periodically in the background. Set this up using cron or a similar scheduler on your deployment of the application -- we use Heroku's scheduler in production.

- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_update_from_streak` every hour
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_update_hackbot_slack_username` every hour

### Deployment on Heroku

We use Heroku for managing our deployment of this project and that brings along some special caveats. Specifically, we rely on multiple buildpacks.

Here are the buildpacks that need to be configured (they must be in the given order):

```
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
heroku/ruby
```

Refer to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks for instructions on configuring buildpacks.
